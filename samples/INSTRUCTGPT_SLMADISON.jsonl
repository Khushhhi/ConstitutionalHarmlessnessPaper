Today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will\nremember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her, a tireless and resolute champion of justice.\"\n\nArchitect of the legal fight for women’s rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on\nthe nation’s highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion\nwhat promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the\nSupreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.\n\nJust days before her death, as her strength waned, Ginsburg dictated this statement to her granddaughter\nClara Spera: \"My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\"\nShe knew what was to come. Ginsburg’s death will have profound consequences for the court and the\ncountry.
